# Generic Box Lab
As business came to us and asked us to create a box that can hold one of its objects for resell. For some reason they think putting an object in a pretty digital box will help drive sales and have people use their object. I tried to tell this this was irrational but they wanted it anyways.

## Requirements

1. The box must hold one item. Since it is meant to be reusable for any object, it has to be generic.
2. The box must be pretty, so it must take a description so users who wish to download the box can be sold on how great the object inside is.
3. The business must be able to put the object in the box.
4. The user must be able to remove the object from the box.
5. The user may only remove the item *once*
6. This box will never be extended nor used anywhere else, so a Box class adequate.
7. Write your unit test to check for adding, removing, setting the description, and reading the description.
